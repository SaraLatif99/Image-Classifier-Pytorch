# Flower-Image-Classifier-Pytorch

This code is my submission for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. In this project, I created a command line application utilizing Pytorch, Neural Networks and Transfer Learning to train a new classifier on top of a pre-existing model trained on ImageNet to identify between 102 different types of flowers.
