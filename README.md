# Flower-Image-Classifier-Pytorch

This code is my submission for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. In this project, I created a command line application utilizing Pytorch, Neural Networks and Transfer Learning to train a new classifier on top of a pre-existing model trained on ImageNet to identify between 102 different types of flowers.

## Use the program

  * Run **train.py** to train the classifier
  * Run **predict.py** to use the checkpoint file created by train.py
  * **processimage.py** contains code to normalize an image you wish to pass to predict.py
  * **network_prep.py** contains all the model loading and configurating modules
